# Checklist

- Have you spent time going through the examples carefully?
- Have you read the constraints properly?
- Are you clearing data in between test cases (if applicable)?
- Are you checking for overflow (`long long`)?
- Have you made sure there are no precision issues (`double` / `long double` not `float`, avoid floating point if not strictly needed)?
- Are you printing doubles with the `fixed` and `setprecision` IO manipulators?
- Have you submitted a slow solution to make sure it doesn't pass?
- Have you stress tested with random case generation?
- Have you used pen and paper?
	- Have you gone through example test cases (solving as a human would)?
	- Is there any pattern in how you're solving test cases on paper that could be generalized?
- Are there any mathematical observations applicable to the problem?
- Have you gone through all possible edge cases?
