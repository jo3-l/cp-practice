> A place to store my solutions to the CCC and various other collections of CP problems, written in Java 8 and C++ 17.<br>

## Note

Recently, I switched to C++ from Java as my main language for competitive programming. To get a hang of the language, I figured I'd revisit some of my old CCC solutions and rewrite them in C++. I plan to write some brief explanations for some of the non-trivial problems, in the hope that they'll be useful for anyone also preparing for the CCC.
